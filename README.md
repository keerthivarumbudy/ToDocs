# ToDocs
Sync completed tasks on Google Tasks --> Google Docs.
Run app.py to move completed tasks from you Google Tasks lists between a specified range of dates to a Google Document of choice to maintain productivity journal without much effort.

Set it up and/or learn how I built it by checking out my [blog post](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/tasks-to-docs/).
